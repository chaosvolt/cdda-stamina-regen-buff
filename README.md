# cdda-stamina-regen-buff
CDDA and CBN mod to rebalance stamina regeneration

If you are using Dark Days Ahead, place the included stamina_regen_buff folder in your data/mods folder. If you are using the Bright Nights fork, use the stamina_regen_buff_BN folder instead. In either case it is recommended that, if updating the mod, to delete the older version of the folder rather than just dumping the new one onto the old one.

The objective of the mod is simple: stamina pool size was multiplied by 10, most activities were increased in cost by up to 10 times, while stamina regen was increased by a much smaller amount. Given the stamina drain walking imposes, this means stamina regeneration tends toward only double its original recovery value, and a bit under while walking. The net result is stamina regeneration is reduced by one-fifth to one-sixth in practice, magnified by the much harsher penalties for being winded plus increased secondary factors draining stamina.

Since present balance has been subject to debate, concerns about game balance, and the resulting status quo is unrealistic, this exists as a workaround making use of the ability to let mods change game-balance external options. This simply increases stamina regeneration so that the effective ratio of stamina burn to regen trends towards half of the old rates, instead of 15-20% as with current balance.
