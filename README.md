CDDA mod to rebalance stamina regeneration

The objective of the mod is simple: stamina pool size was multiplied by 10, most activities were increased in cost by up to 10 times, while stamina regen was increased by a much smaller amount. Given the stamina drain walking imposes, this means stamina regeneration tends toward only double its orginal recovery value, and a bit under while walking. The net result is stamina regneration is reduced by one-fifth to one-sixth in practice, magnified by the much harsher penalties for being winded plus increased secondary factors draining stamina.

Since present balance has been subject to debate, concerns about game balance, and the resulting status quo is unrealistic, this exists as a workaround making use of the ability to let mods change game-balance external options. This simply increases stamina regeneration so that the effective ratio of stamina burn to regen trends towards half of the old rates, instead of 15-20% as with current balance.
